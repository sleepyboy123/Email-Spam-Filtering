Hi Antonio,

Among other things, you'll find that you're not the first person who was ever confused and frightened and even sickened by human behavior. 
You're by no means alone on that score, you'll be excited and stimulated to know. 
Many, many men have been just as troubled morally and spiritually as you are right now. 
Happily, some of them kept records of their troubles. You'll learn from them if you want to. 
Just as someday, if you have something to offer, someone will learn something from you. 
It's a beautiful reciprocal arrangement. And it isn't education. It's history. It's poetry.

Anyway, I keep picturing all these little kids playing some game in this big field of rye and all. 
Thousands of little kids, and nobody's around nobody big, I mean except me. 
And I'm standing on the edge of some crazy cliff. What I have to do, 
I have to catch everybody if they start to go over the cliff I mean if they're running and they don't look where they're going I have to come out from somewhere and catch them. That's all I do all day. I'd just be the catcher in the rye and all. I know it's crazy, but that's the only thing I'd really like to be.

Thanks!
Matthew
